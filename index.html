<p>It sucks, doesn't it? You've got a constant ringing in your ear and you don't know how rid of it. Fortunately, science is doing its thing and there are some treatments that look promising. This web application provides one such treatment.</p>

<p>Simply put, none exist. The mechanism(s) behind tinnitus aren't well understood so it's incredibly difficult to come up with a treatment. That said, there are some organisations out there pioneering treatments of various types. All the ones that exist at the time of writing either require payment (some wanting upwards of $1000) or have been provided for free but have since disappeared. This web application should also be considered a pioneering treatment and doesn't guarantee results.</p>

<p>This web application allows you to pinpoint the frequency of your tinnitus and apply treatment based on that frequency. The treatment is based on the one used by <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilya_Adamchic/publication/221892572_Counteracting_tinnitus_by_acoustic_coordinated_reset_neuromodulation/links/5440371e0cf21227a11ba78d.pdf">Tass et al. (2012)</a>.</p>
